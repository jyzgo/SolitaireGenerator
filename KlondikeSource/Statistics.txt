1000 random games ran with the minimal solver with a maximum of 60 million states.
'Solvable' means getting all cards to the foundation, 'impossible' otherwise.
'Most likely impossible' means the game terminated after evaluating 60 million states and failed to find a solution.
They are most likely impossible since games that do have a solution will most likely show up before 5 million states.
